Jorgicio Custom Overlay
=======================

Made by Jorge Pizarro Callejas, aka Jorgicio (http://www.jorgicio.net).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a Custom repository made by me.

Usage
-----

First, install Layman from the official Portage tree. Must use the use-flag USE="git" at the moment of installation.

    emerge layman

~~Then, in the section "overlays" in the /etc/layman/layman.cfg, add the following URL:
https://raw.github.com/jorgicio/jorgicio-gentoo/master/jorgicio-repo.xml~~

**That's not necessary!!! Now this overlay is official and added to the list.** Check it [here](http://gpo.zugaina.org/Overlays).

And then, run the following command:

    layman -f -a jorgicio

And you're done.

If you want to refresh the overlay (and all another overlays), just type:

    layman -S

That's all, folks!
